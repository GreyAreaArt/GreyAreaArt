- Grey Area Fine Art is a new NFT mint and NFT art gallery that has both a private featured artists page and an open canon mint page where anyone can mint their art cheaply on the Polygon blockchain.

- 👀 I’m interested in NFT art and sustainable cryptocurrency.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about using Web3 and dApp integrations with my website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on art pieces, dApps, and more!
